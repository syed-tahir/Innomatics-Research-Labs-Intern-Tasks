This repository contains my daily tasks, assignments, and project work completed as part of my internship/training at Innomatics Research Labs.
The purpose of this repository is to:

  1. Maintain structured documentation of daily learning
  2. Track progress consistently
  3. Practice industry-level coding standards
  4. Build discipline in version control and GitHub usage
